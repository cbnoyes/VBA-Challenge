# VBA-Challenge

 For this Challenge I received help from a tutor through BCS who helped me through the first half of the challenge, (making the variables, adding the ticker, yearly change, percent change, total stock volume)
 The location of this code that is mainly in the first for loop (for i). He also taught me how to make the code work for all worksheets

 The second part (the for j loop) was mainly achieved through finding functions I was not familiar with (Autofit and Numberformat) through google (learn.microsoft and educaba respectively)
